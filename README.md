A small ESP32 dashboard for your desk that keeps an eye on coding-agent usage.

It runs on a [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-amoled-2.16.htm?&aff_id=149786) as well as a few other alternative boards and pairs over Bluetooth, the splash screen plays pixel-art animations that get
busier when your usage rate climbs. The two side buttons send Space and
Shift+Tab over BLE HID for Claude Code's voice mode and mode-toggle shortcuts.

## Providers

Hold the right button to switch which plan the screen is showing. The host
daemon polls every provider it can read and sends them in one payload, so the
switch is instant rather than waiting for the next poll.

| Provider | Source | Screen |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Claude** | Claude Code's OAuth token → `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` response headers | Warm palette, serif title, Clawd. The Weekly card flips between all-models and any scoped-model allowance (e.g. Fable). |
| **Codex** | Codex CLI's OAuth token → `chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`, with the session rollout logs as an offline fallback | Neutral palette, sans throughout, and any of the eight ChatGPT pets. Shows the model's weekly quota above the account's. |

Adding a provider means writing one collector against the interface in
[`daemon/collectors/`](daemon/collectors/__init__.py) — a normalized
`UsageSnapshot` the daemon consumes without knowing which vendor produced it.

**[`docs/petmeter.md`](docs/petmeter.md)** documents everything this fork
adds: the collector interface, the wire format, the theme and art-set systems,
the pet sprite pipeline, the button and serial controls, and the traps found
building it.

## Screens

The device boots into the splash. Tap the screen anywhere to switch to the Usage view; tap again to flip back to the splash.

|              Splash               |              Usage              |
| :-------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| ![Splash](screenshots/splash.gif) | ![Usage](screenshots/usage.png) |
|   Splash; touch-toggle anytime    | Session and weekly utilization  |

While the splash is up, the middle (PWR) button cycles animations. **Hold the power button for 3 seconds, then release, to put the device into pairing mode** — this clears the saved Bluetooth bond and re-advertises. The firmware also auto-rotates animations every 20 s within the current usage-rate group, so a long stretch on the splash isn't just one Clawd on loop.

**Porting to another board:** the firmware is a thin HAL with per-board folders under `firmware/src/boards/`. Drop in a new folder and a new PlatformIO env — `main.cpp`, `ui.cpp`, and `splash.cpp` never need to change. See [`docs/porting/adding-a-board.md`](docs/porting/adding-a-board.md) for the walk-through and [`docs/porting/hal-contract.md`](docs/porting/hal-contract.md) for the interfaces a port must implement.

## Prerequisites

- Linux (tested on Ubuntu), macOS, or Windows 10/11
- [PlatformIO CLI](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/index.html)
- Linux: `curl`, `bluetoothctl`, `busctl` (BlueZ Bluetooth stack)
- macOS: `python3` (the installer sets up a venv with `bleak` and `httpx`)
- Windows: `python3` 3.11+ (the installer sets up a venv with `bleak`, `httpx`, and `pystray`)
- Claude Code with an active subscription

## macOS installation

The macOS host pieces — Python daemon, LaunchAgent, and flash helper — were ported by [Chris Davidson (@lorddavidson)](https://github.com/lorddavidson). Thanks Chris!

### Flash the firmware

```bash
./flash-mac.sh waveshare_amoled_216                       # ESP32-S3 2.16" (auto-detects /dev/cu.usbmodem*)
./flash-mac.sh waveshare_amoled_216_c6                    # ESP32-C6 2.16" variant
./flash-mac.sh waveshare_amoled_18  /dev/cu.usbmodem1101  # ESP32-S3 1.8" (or pass an explicit USB serial port)
```

The board env name is required. Run `./flash-mac.sh` with no args to see the available envs (scraped from `firmware/platformio.ini`).

### Pair the device

After flashing, open **System Settings → Bluetooth** and click _Connect_ next to "Clawdmeter". The daemon only ever connects to the peripheral this Mac is paired/connected to — it never scans for a nearby device — so once it's connected here the daemon picks it up on its next poll (~60 s).

### Install the daemon

The daemon reads your Claude OAuth token from the macOS Keychain (service `Claude Code-credentials`), polls usage every 60 s, and pushes it to the display over BLE.

```bash
./install-mac.sh
```

The installer creates a Python venv in `daemon/.venv/`, installs `bleak` and `httpx`, renders a LaunchAgent into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.claude-usage-daemon.plist`, and loads it. The first run is launched interactively so macOS prompts for Bluetooth permission.

Useful commands:

```bash
launchctl list | grep claude-usage                                          # check it's running
tail -F ~/Library/Logs/claude-usage-daemon.out.log                          # live logs
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.claude-usage-daemon.plist  # stop
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.claude-usage-daemon.plist # start
```

## Linux installation

### Flash the firmware

```bash
./flash.sh waveshare_amoled_216                  # ESP32-S3 2.16" (defaults to /dev/ttyACM0)
./flash.sh waveshare_amoled_216_c6               # ESP32-C6 2.16" variant
./flash.sh waveshare_amoled_18  /dev/ttyACM1     # ESP32-S3 1.8" (or pass an explicit USB serial port)
```

The board env name is required. Run `./flash.sh` with no args to see the available envs (scraped from `firmware/platformio.ini`).

### Pair the device

After flashing, the device advertises as "Clawdmeter". Pair it once:

```bash
# Scan for the device
bluetoothctl scan le

# When "Clawdmeter" appears, pair and trust it
bluetoothctl pair F4:12:FA:C0:8F:E5    # use your device's MAC
bluetoothctl trust F4:12:FA:C0:8F:E5
```

To re-pair later, hold the power button for 3 seconds then release — the device clears its saved bond and re-advertises.

### Install the daemon

The daemon polls your Claude usage every 60 seconds and sends it to the display over BLE.

```bash
./install.sh
systemctl --user start claude-usage-daemon
```

Check status: `systemctl --user status claude-usage-daemon`

View logs: `journalctl --user -u claude-usage-daemon -f`

## Windows installation

Runs natively on Windows — no WSL required. A system-tray app polls your usage and pushes it over BLE, and starts automatically at login.

### Prerequisites

- **Native Windows** (not WSL).
- **Python 3.11+** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) — check _"Add python.exe to PATH"_ during install.
- **Claude Code** installed, with `claude login` completed. The token is read from `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` (falling back to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude\` then `%APPDATA%\Claude\`).
- The repo on a **native Windows path** (e.g. `%USERPROFILE%\Clawdmeter`), **not** a `\\wsl$` share — the installer refuses a WSL path.

### Flash the firmware

```powershell
pio run -d firmware -e waveshare_amoled_216 -t upload --upload-port COM5   # use your device's COM port
```

Run `pio run -d firmware` with no env to see the available board envs.

### Pair the device

The device is a bonded BLE HID keyboard, so pair it once: **Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Add device → Bluetooth**, then select "Clawdmeter". Pairing is **required** — it enables the physical buttons and keeps a persistent connection (the device keeps showing your last-synced usage even after the daemon quits). To undo, use **Remove device** (this disables the buttons).

### Install the daemon (recommended)

From the repo root in PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install-windows.ps1
```

This creates a venv, installs `bleak`/`httpx`/`pystray`/`Pillow` from the in-repo requirements (no internet downloads), registers a per-user login-autostart entry (`HKCU\…\Run`, no admin needed), and launches the tray app headlessly (no console window).

### Run manually instead (optional)

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1        # if blocked: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned, then retry
pip install -r daemon\requirements-windows.txt
python daemon\claude_usage_daemon_windows.py        # runs in the foreground; Ctrl+C to stop
```

### Tray icon and menu

The icon's corner bubble shows state — **green** Connected, **amber** Scanning, **red** Error — and hovering shows the status (`Connected · last update HH:MM`). A notification fires once when it enters Error (e.g. an expired token). Right-click for the menu:

- **Status header** — live state + last sync time.
- **Start at login** — toggle autostart on/off.
- **Quit** — stops the daemon cleanly; leaves the Windows pairing intact (device keeps its last reading).

### Logs and troubleshooting

```powershell
Get-Content $env:LOCALAPPDATA\Clawdmeter\daemon.log -Tail 30        # view logs
reg delete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v Clawdmeter /f   # remove autostart
```

## How it works

<img src="assets/readme/magnifier.gif" width="150" align="right" alt="">

1. The daemon reads your Claude Code OAuth token — from the macOS Keychain (service `Claude Code-credentials`) on macOS, or from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on Linux (`%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` on Windows).
2. It makes a minimal API call to `api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` — one token of Haiku, basically free.
3. The usage numbers come straight out of the response headers (`anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-utilization` and friends).
4. The daemon connects to the ESP32 over BLE and writes a JSON payload to the GATT RX characteristic.
5. The firmware parses it and updates the LVGL dashboard.
6. The firmware also tracks the rate of change of session % over a 5-minute window and picks splash animations from the matching mood group.
7. The two side buttons are independent of all of this — they send Space and Shift+Tab as BLE HID keyboard input to the paired host directly.

## Physical buttons

The board has three side buttons. Left and right send HID keys; the middle (PWR) button cycles splash animations and, held for 3 seconds, triggers pairing mode.

| Button           | GPIO         | Function                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Left**         | GPIO 0       | Hold to send Space (Claude Code voice-mode push-to-talk)     |
| **Middle** (PWR) | AXP2101 PKEY | On splash: cycle animations. Hold 3s + release: pairing mode |
| **Right**        | GPIO 18      | Press to send Shift+Tab (Claude Code mode toggle)            |

Space and Shift+Tab go out as standard BLE HID keyboard reports, so they trigger in whatever window has focus on the paired host — not just Claude Code.

## BLE protocol

The device advertises a custom GATT service alongside the standard HID keyboard service:

|                            | UUID                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Data Service**           | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000001` |
| RX Characteristic (write)  | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000002` |
| TX Characteristic (notify) | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000003` |
| **HID Service**            | `00001812-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` |

JSON payload format (written to RX):

```json
{ "s": 45, "sr": 120, "w": 28, "wr": 7200, "st": "allowed", "ok": true }
```

Fields: `s` = session %, `sr` = session reset (minutes), `w` = weekly %, `wr` = weekly reset (minutes), `st` = status, `ok` = success flag.

Optional fields (omitted when not applicable; the firmware treats absence as "feature off"): `ws` = weekly scoped-model limits for plans that meter specific models separately, as `[{"n":"Fable","p":75}, ...]` — one entry per scoped model, labeled with the API's own display name. They share the weekly reset, so no separate reset field is sent. When `ws` is present, `w` is re-based on the same OAuth-usage source as the scoped percentages rather than the rate-limit header, so both weekly numbers carry identical rounding (the header is a 2-decimal fraction, the endpoint a rounded integer — mixing them can render a real 12.6/12.4 pair as 12/12).

`x` = a second provider's usage, same field names nested one level down, for devices showing more than one plan. Claude stays at the top level so an older firmware ignores the key entirely. Within it, `has_s` / `has_w` mark which panels carry a real quota — a Codex Pro account meters one weekly window and no 5-hour one, and a slot with nothing behind it renders blank rather than a convincing 0%. `sm` / `wm` override the panel pills, so a panel showing one model's slice can say which (`"Spark"`, `"Overall"`) instead of `Current` / `Weekly`.

## Development

<img src="assets/readme/crab.gif" width="120" align="right" alt="">

- **Desktop simulator** — iterate on the UI without hardware: an SDL2 window
  runs the full firmware loop with scenario playback (`pio run -d firmware -e
sim`, then `cd firmware && .pio/build/sim/program`). See
  [`SIM-USAGE.md`](SIM-USAGE.md) for controls, scenarios, and headless
  screenshots.
- **Splash animations** — Anthropic's official Clawd sprites, archived with
  provenance notes in [`research/clawd-official/`](research/clawd-official/);
  `node tools/convert_official_clawd.js` regenerates
  `firmware/src/splash_animations.h`. See [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md).
- **Icons** — Lucide PNGs convert to LVGL C arrays with
  `tools/png_to_lvgl.js`. See [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md).
- **Fonts** — the pre-compiled LVGL fonts and the LVGL-9 patching they need:
  [`docs/fonts.md`](docs/fonts.md).
- **Porting** — [`docs/porting/adding-a-board.md`](docs/porting/adding-a-board.md)
  and [`docs/porting/hal-contract.md`](docs/porting/hal-contract.md).

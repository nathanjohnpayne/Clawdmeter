"""Provider-agnostic usage collection.

Petmeter shows usage for more than one coding-agent plan (Claude Code today,
Codex next, Cursor later). Each provider exposes its numbers differently --
Anthropic returns them as response headers on any API call, Codex serves a
JSON usage endpoint -- so each gets a Collector, and the daemon only ever sees
the normalized UsageSnapshot below.

Free-ride credential rule (inherited from the Claude collector, see
daemon/tests/test_freeride.py): a collector NEVER refreshes an OAuth token.
The CLI that owns the token does all refreshing; a collector reads whatever
access token is currently stored and reports `None` when it is dead, which the
daemon renders as "No data" on the device. A collector that refreshes tokens
races the owning CLI and can invalidate its session.
